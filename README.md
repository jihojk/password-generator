# password-generator

## Introduction

This app generates a password based on user-selected criteria. 
Instead of a pop-up prompt, I decided to try and utilize a check-mark system and an input for the lenght of password.

Here, the user will choose from the following password criteria:
- Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters).
- The usage of special characters.
- The usage of numeric characters.
- The usage of lower case characters.
- The usage of upper case characters.

Unexpected input will prompt an alert and will ask for a valid input. 
The application will also include a "Copy" button that will copy the password to clipboard.

!!! Current Update: I am unable to get the value to generate. I believe my method of trying to randomize the numbers and also the way I defined the variables for the random values was a bit too complicated.
