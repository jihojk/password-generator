## Introduction

This app generates a password based on user-selected criteria. 
A prompt will pop up When the user clicks on the "Generate Password Button."

Here, the user will choose from the following password criteria:
- Length (must be between 8 and 128 characters).
- The usage of special characters.
- The usage of numeric characters.
- The usage of lower case characters.
- The usage of upper case characters.

Unexpected input will prompt an alert and will ask for a valid input. 
The application will also include a "Copy" button that will copy the password to clipboard.
